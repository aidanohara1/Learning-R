## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Data Types and Structures

Lots of intricacies of data types and structures.
I finally tuned in for it all when we got to factors. 
Something about attributes, the major use of attributes in R.

Keep in mind, if you leave data in, and it has any charecter data, or perhaps R has misinterprested you data as charecters
Ensure that the charecters are not inadvertently converted to factors.

## Data Frames
The most famous piece of built in data, mt cars.

```{r summary(mtcars)}
```

Offers you sample data information about cars.
Data about their mpg, disp, horsepower, weight, and many more.

Data Frames are best considered lists of lists, notably they can contain heterogeneous data, chars and floats for example.

```{r is.data.frame(mtcars)}
```

### How do we view just parts of our data.frame
 
```{r mtcars[,2]}
```
 Shows us just the second column of mtcars, without the header.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
